 Meeting 1 – Project Kick-off
 Date: Week 1
 Participants: Tom Nicolaï, Titouan Lepesqueur, Paul Fortune Corroy
 Objectives: - Brainstorm project ideas related to aeronautics and AI - Select a feasible and innovative
 topic
 Discussion: Several ideas were proposed during the brainstorming session. The team agreed on
 focusing on aircraft maintenance and safety. The idea of detecting cracks on aircraft fuselages using
 computer vision was selected due to its strong industrial relevance and feasibility with available tools.
 Decisions: - Project topic validated: automatic detection of fuselage cracks - Use of AI and image
 processing
 Action items: - Research existing solutions and datasets (Team)
 Meeting 2 – Technical Research & Tool Selection
 Date: Week 2
 Participants: Team
 Discussion: The team conducted research on computer vision techniques and platforms. Roboflow was
 identified as a suitable solution due to its dataset management, model training, and API deployment
 features.
 Decisions: - Use Roboflow for dataset management and model training - Use a hosted detection model
 with API access
 Action items: - Collect a large dataset of fuselage crack images (Team)
 Meeting 3 – Dataset & Training
 Date: Week 3
 Participants: Team
 Discussion: The team collected close to 1000 images of aircraft fuselages with visible cracks. More than
 800 images were used for training the model. The training process lasted approximately 5 hours on
 Roboflow.
 Decisions: - Validate dataset quality - Proceed with full model training
 2
Action items: - Monitor training performance - Prepare inference tests (Tom)
 Meeting 4 – Implementation & Integration
 Date: Week 4
 Participants: Team
 Discussion: Integration of the Roboflow model into a Python script was challenging, especially for
 retrieving the API key and inference URL. After several attempts, the team successfully implemented a
 working pipeline.
 Decisions: - Final validation of the detection pipeline - Prepare project artefacts and portfolio
 Action items: - Clean and comment the code - Prepare documentation
