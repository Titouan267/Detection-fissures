## 🗓️ Meeting 1 – Project Kick-off

**Date:** Week 1  
**Participants:** Tom Nicolaï, Titouan Lepesqueur, Paul Fortune Corroy  

### Objectives
- Brainstorm project ideas related to aeronautics and artificial intelligence  
- Select a feasible and innovative project topic  

### Discussion
Several project ideas were proposed during the brainstorming session.  
The team agreed to focus on aircraft maintenance and safety.  
The idea of **detecting cracks on aircraft fuselages using computer vision** was selected due to its strong industrial relevance and feasibility with available tools.

### Decisions
- Project topic validated: *Automatic detection of fuselage cracks*  
- Use of artificial intelligence and image processing techniques  

### Action Items
- Research existing solutions and available datasets *(Team)*

## 🗓️ Meeting 2 – Technical Research & Tool Selection

**Date:** Week 2  
**Participants:** Team  

### Discussion
The team carried out research on computer vision methods and development platforms.  
**Roboflow** was identified as a suitable solution due to its features for dataset management, model training, and API-based deployment.

### Decisions
- Use Roboflow for dataset management and model training  
- Deploy the detection model via a hosted API  

### Action Items
- Collect a large dataset of aircraft fuselage crack images *(Team)*

## 🗓️ Meeting 3 – Dataset Preparation & Model Training

**Date:** Week 3  
**Participants:** Team  

### Discussion
Nearly **1000 images** of aircraft fuselages with visible cracks were collected.  
More than **800 images** were used to train the detection model.  
The training process lasted approximately **5 hours** on the Roboflow platform.

### Decisions
- Validate dataset quality  
- Proceed with full model training  

### Action Items
- Monitor training performance  
- Prepare inference tests *(Tom)*  

---

## 🗓️ Meeting 4 – Implementation & Integration

**Date:** Week 4  
**Participants:** Team  

### Discussion
Integrating the Roboflow model into a Python script proved challenging, particularly when retrieving the API key and inference URL.  
After several attempts and debugging sessions, the team successfully implemented a fully working inference pipeline.

### Decisions
- Final validation of the crack detection pipeline  
- Preparation of project artefacts and portfolio  

### Action Items
- Clean and comment the source code  
- Prepare final documentation
